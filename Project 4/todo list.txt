create a register class?   List < Queue <Customer> > 
register can have a queue of customers


	customers need to have a unique attribute (doesnt have to be names but that could work)
	
	
	add customer method (enqueue dequeue basically) 
register size  method to determ if a customer should take that register.

when a customer reaches the front of the line, exit event
register.ToString() will be how we generate what  and how many customers is in the register

each customer has there own processing time? convert to mins or something and compare it to the specified time that the store is open?

CONVERT ALL TIME TO SECONDSa

 A display that simply lists all events, the times they occurred, etc., 
 and leaves it to the reader to extract the useful information from the display would not be considered very helpful.
